# Blog App

<br>This is a simple blog application built using the Django framework. 
The app allows you to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. 
It also includes features like user authentication and authorization, 
commenting system, and search functionality.
<br><br>
To get started, make sure you have Django installed on your system. <br><br>
You can install it using pip by running the following command in your terminal:<br>
_pip install django_<br>
<br>
Once you have Django installed, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate 
to the project directory in your terminal. 
<br>Then, run the following commands to 
create the database and start the development server:<br>
_python manage.py migrate<br>
python manage.py runserver<br>_
<br><br>
You can now access the blog app by visiting http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser. 
<br><br>From there, you can create an account, log in, and start creating blog posts.
